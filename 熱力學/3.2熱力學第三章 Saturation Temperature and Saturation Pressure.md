# 主旨
The temperature at which water starts boiling depends on the pressure
沸點的溫度決定於壓力

>Water boils at 100$^o$C at 1 atm pressure
___
## Saturation temperature $T_{sat}$
The temperature at which a pure substance changes phase at a given pressure

飽和溫度是指液體和蒸氣處於動態平衡狀態即飽和狀態時所具有的溫度

## Saturation pressure$P_{sat}$
The pressure at which a pure substance changes phase at a given temperature

___

## Latent heat 潛熱
The amount of energy absorbed or released during a phase - change process

在相變中吸收或放出的能量總數

## Latent heat of fusion  熔化潛熱

The amount of energy absorbed during melting. It is equivalent to the amount of energy released during freezing.

在熔化的時候吸收的能量總量，跟該物質凝固所需能量相等

## Latent heat of vaporization 汽化潛熱

The amount of energy absorbed during vaporization and it is equivalent to the energy released during condensation.

在汽化時所吸收的能量總數，跟該物質凝結時所需能量相等

>The magnitudes of the latent heats depend on the temperature or pressure at which the phase change occurs.
>潛熱的大小決定於該環境的溫度或壓力影響的相變化

>At 1 atm pressure, the latent heat of fusion of water is 333.7 kJ/kg and the latent heat of vaporization is 2256.5 kJ/kg.
